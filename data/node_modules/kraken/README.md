kraken - a Node.js client for Kraken.io API
===========

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/matylla/node-kraken.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/matylla/node-kraken)

With this Node module you can plug into the power and speed of [Kraken.io](http://kraken.io/) Image Optimizer.

## Installation

    npm install kraken

## Getting Started

First you need to create your [Kraken Account](http://kraken.io/developers/) (for free) and obtain your unique Kraken API Key. You will find your API Key in your [Account Settings](http://kraken.io/developers/account). Once you have created (and activated) your account, you can start using Kraken API in your applications.

## How to use

You can optimize your images in two ways - by providing an URL of the image you want to optimize or by uploading an image file from your disk directly to Kraken API. The first option (image URL) is great for images that are already in production environment or any other place available on the Internet. The second one (image upload) is ideal for deployment process or build script where you don't have your images on the Internet yet.

## Usage - Image URL

To optimize an image by providing image URL use the `kraken.optimize()` method:

````js
var Kraken = require('kraken');

var kraken = new Kraken({
  'user': 'your-kraken-username',
  'pass': 'your-kraken-password',
  'apikey': 'your-kraken-api-key'
});

var image = {
  'url': 'http://image-url-to-optimize'
};

kraken.optimize(image, function(status) {
  if (status.success) {
    console.log('Success. Optimized image URL: %s', status.krakedURL);
  } else {
    console.log('Fail. Error message: %s', status.error);
  }
});
````

## Usage - Image Upload

If you want to upload your images directly to Kraken API use the `kraken.upload()` method:

````js
var Kraken = require('kraken');

var kraken = new Kraken({
  'user': 'your-kraken-username',
  'pass': 'your-kraken-password',
  'apikey': 'your-kraken-api-key'
});

var image = '/Path/To/File.jpg';

kraken.upload(image, function(status) {
  if (status.success) {
    console.log('Success. Optimized image URL: %s', status.krakedURL);
  } else {
    console.log('Fail. Error message: %s', status.error);
  }
});
````
